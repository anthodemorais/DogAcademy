const text = `Washing your dog is important, but not as important as some people think. Healthy dogs **actually don't need to be washed all that often**, but humans prefer to bathe them so that they have a more pleasing smell and appearance.

### Why bathing your dog is important ?
Bathing a dog needs to be given more emphasis. This is because of the fact that if you are careless in bathing, the animal may end up having some infections.

For example, if you don't close the ears with large cotton ball, the water may enter into ear canals and may cause some ear infections with signs like constant discharge from the ears and head shaking.

Frequency of bathing actually depends on the breed of the dog. If the dog is of a hairy type like the cocker spaniel, then the bathing is to be carried out once in six to eight weeks. If these breeds are bathed too frequently, then the skin and coat loose the protective characters.

However, when the dog has defecated on the skin due to the frequent digestive upsets leading to diarrhea, to avoid the bad smell, the dog may be subjected to frequent bathing some times by the owners.

Doggie bath time is a good time to spend with the dog, however. Although most of them don't like to be washed, they will appreciate the contact and attention that they receive from their owners during a bath.

It is also a good time to perform some other necessary dog maintenance such as cleaning the ears, checking for ticks and fleas, and brushing the teeth. Since many dogs do not like to sit still for any of these activities, it can be a good idea to do them all at once.

### How to bath a dog
#### Choosing the right products
You first need to take care of choosing the right soap for your dog. There is no right soap for every dog, it depends on your dog's breed, his hair type and length, his age and his allergies.

Also, take care in avoiding some irritant soaps or human soaps. The soap materials used for human beings are not suitable for dogs.

Similarly, many human shampoo products are having some ingredients that are not suitable in the proportions that are to be used in case of dogs. Hence, always try to use the shampoo products that are mentioned mainly for use in dogs. Take more care in using any new product.

Always have good time and patience for products required for bathing in one place with availability of water source. Dogs love the sprinkling of water, river, and oceans.  Even when you are using bathtub, have everything in one place and then start bathing of the dog. Try to have a leash, conditioner, towel, and shampoo in the bath place.

Conditioner is of helpful to make the combing activity easier later. Bathing should be a convenient activity to both the dog and the owner. This should not be a burden.

#### Brushing Dogs' Teeth
Unknown to many, even to some dog owners, dogs as young as 3 years old can have gingivitis if they are not given regular tooth brushing.

Gingivitis is a gum infection that affects the bloodstream to the vital organs of your dog's body that could potentially lead to more serious health problems. Thus, making sure that your dog receives a regular brushing of teeth will prevent this from happening. To further keep the chances low, have vets check your dog's teeth periodically.

Brushing your dogs' teeth is just good dental hygiene. Most vets recommend that it be done at least twice a week to ensure your dog maintains healthy teeth and gums. If you've not been doing this (and, unfortunately, many people don't) it's never too late to start.

The dog should have its own toothbrush and special toothpaste designed for dogs. Make sure you brush the back teeth in small circles, the same way you would your own, and brush up and down the length of the pointy canine teeth. Dog toothpaste is made to have a pleasing taste (for the dog, don't try it yourself) and this should make the dog willing to let you perform this activity.

#### Checking for Ticks and Fleas
Ticks are nasty little arachnids (they're eight-legged creatures like spiders, and therefore are not insects) that will latch onto your dog's skin and make its blood their meal ticket.

They are most common in wooded areas, but your dog should be checked for them regularly because they can carry a number of diseases. The best place to look for these bugs in under the collar or on the dog's underbelly, buried in the fur. If found they can be removed with tweezers.

Fleas can be found in the same places, under the fur. The presence of fleas can be betrayed by the sight of their droppings on the dog's coat. They look like flecks of pepper.

The fleas themselves look like bits of brown rice. They're about an eighth of an inch long. They can't simply be picked off of the dog like ticks can, but finding them will let you know it's time to start the dog on a program to control and eliminate the insects.

#### Cleaning the Ears
Pet supply stores sell special solutions for cleansing a dog's ears. Dogs can easily get ear mites, small insects which live in the ears and feed of the waxy secretions there. Over time the bodies of these short-lived creatures build up and form a black, dirty substance.

Using a cotton swab dipped in a bit of this solution, gently clean the inner ear. It may be difficult to hold the dog still for this procedure, but it doesn't take long. And the result will be clean ears and the avoidance of potential infection and earaches in the dog.

#### Coat brushing
If for you, combing your hair is important, what more to your dog? Fur covers the entire body of your dog while your hair only covers the top of your head. Thus, your dog requires more brushing than you do.

What's the point of doing this? Dogs - especially dogs with long coat - that do not receive regular brushing can develop matting. And this is a bad thing. Matts can cause lesions and sores.  Also, un-groomed dogs can acquire parasites such as ticks and fleas underneath their matted coat.

So when you are bathing your dog, spend time cleaning the fur carefully and brush it nice and softly at the end.

#### Don't forget nails clipping
What would you feel if you don't cut your nails of your fingers and toes for years? Have you seen the man with the longest fingernails on television? What discomfort would that bring to you being unable to do your daily task with long fingernails?

Same thing goes with your dog. If your dog has long nails, it could not run well. They could even hurt themselves. Make sure that nail cutting is part of your dog' grooming routine will keep your dogs active.

### Bathing is not enough
If you want your dog to be healthy and prevent infection, ticks and fleas and dental issues, bathing is not enough. Regular check-ups are essential.

It's pretty easy to see if humans are sick. They are pale, weak and they can speak about how they feel. However, for dogs, it is quite different. Signs of sickness are not very evident. Thus, spotting if your dog is sick or not may be different from spotting a sick human.

The point here is, since dogs may not seem to show some signs of sickness compared to humans, extensive care, regular grooming routine and check-ups are required. This will keep you from guessing if your dog is well or not. Regular dog grooming routine and check-ups will keep you confident that your dog stays healthy and clean.

On the other hand, when you see a subtle, yet clear manifestation that your dog is becoming sick; respond to it quickly by brushing its teeth, giving him a bath, and visiting a veterinarian.

#### The importance of regular check-ups
Why are regular check-ups important? Every dog owner often asks this type of question. If you failed to do the regular check-ups, then your dog may end up having some major diseases that you don't know about.

One may not be able to find out the very commonly occurring clinical conditions in case of their dogs because of less experience with dog diseases or dog rearing.

Hence, you need to pay lot of money both to the veterinarians for consultancy and for the required drugs useful for the therapy of the clinical condition.

If the dog has any signs of illness, then you shouldn't wait for the regular check-up. Instead, you need to approach the veterinarian immediately. Check ups if done in a regular manner will help to give vaccinations against canine distemper, parvovirus, rabies virus, hepatitis virus, and more.

### Conclusion
Why is dog bathing important? If until now, the answer is still unclear to you, then know this; grooming is as important to your dog as it is important to you.`
