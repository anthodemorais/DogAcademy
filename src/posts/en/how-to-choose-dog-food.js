const text = `When choosing the type of dog food to feed your dog, you need to consider his **age**, **breed**, your dog's **activity level** and also his **health condition**. For instance, puppies and older dogs will have different types of nutritional needs and you need to ensure your dog or puppy has sufficient consumption of these nutrition for a long and healthy life. It is best if you **seek advice** from your veterinarian before deciding on which dog food to feed your dog or puppy.

Two most popular choices of dog foods are:

### Dry Dog Food

Feeding your dog with dry dog food, usually in small pieces of kibbles, is perhaps one of the most popular choices among dog owners. However, not all dog food brands use high quality natural ingredients. Ensure to **read the label of ingredients** listed before purchasing any brands of dog food. Here are some guidelines to help you to have some ideas of what the label **actually tells you**:

- **No Preservative, Artificial Colors and Flavors.** Generally, natural dog food contains no preservative, artificial colors and flavors. Consumption of these components may be harmful to your dog's health if taken in a long run. Avoid those that labeled 'chemical additives as a source of flavor'. 

- **Color**. Lookout for the color of the dog food, generally dog food made from natural ingredients is in soft earth tones. Existence of other colors may contain some source of additives. 

- **The Type of Meat**. Avoid brands that labeled 'ingredients include meat by-product'. Choose one that made from natural meat such as chicken, lamb or liver. 

### Raw Dog Food.

According to veterinarian, feeding your dog with raw dog food is the **healthiest** and the best. Raw dog food contains all natural and unprocessed ingredients. A healthy raw dog food meal usually contains **40% meat, 30% fiber and 30% starch**. Thereby, when preparing a meal for your dog, be sure to include some source of **vegetables** and **starch** in addition to the uncooked meat such as liver, beef, lamb and etc. Types of vegetables like broccoli, carrots and yams are all good sources of fibers and starches for your dog.

### Dry Vs. Canned food

These types of food materials are different with different grades of liking by the dogs. Dogs like dry foods only if they are **tasty** and however, on comparison, the dogs prefer only the canned food items. Reason for such preference by the dogs is that in case of canned food items, the moisture is about seventy to eighty per cent but in case of dry food, it is only about ten per cent. 

However, if you view it in terms of nutrients, often the dry food contains nearly **90% nutrients** whereas the canned food items contain only less per cent of nutrients and most of the times. It is only soy products that are structured so well to look like meat pieces. 

Hence, to make up the nutritional balance in the body systems, the dog has to **eat more** amounts of canned food materials than the dry food materials. Hence, just compare the cost factor related to this feature by you. Many dry food items are soybean and rice based. 

Now some dry food items are based on corn. Sometimes, beef based or chicken based food items come in the cans along with mineral and vitamin supplements suited for the upkeep of the dog's health status. Larger dogs that weigh more than thirty pounds need to be fed with **semi moist** food items or dry food items in most of the occasions. 

This is to satisfy the food receptors in the stomach. This is due to the fact that the larger dogs need to eat plenty of moist food or the canned food items to satisfy these criteria. But it may not be practically possible in these larger dogs. The small sized dogs may have a satisfactory level of nutrients if fed even the moist food items. 
However, the caloric density of the dry food should not be forgotten. **Enriched dry food items are highly welcome** ones than the non-enriched food items. 

### Choosing Healthy Dog Food

Today's pet food market is larger and more diverse than ever before. While this offers a large number of choices in various types of pet food, it also presents a dilemma in choosing the healthiest food for your dog. Are generic or store brands suitable for a dog? What about familiar name brands like Purina and Alpo? Are the pricier brands that advertise specially formulated ingredients (Science Diet, Eukanuba) really living up to their claims and worth the extra money? All of these are valid questions that loving dog owners deserve to have answered.

### Dog Food Considerations

There are **several factors** to consider when choosing the right food for your dog. Different dogs have different nutritional needs at different stages in their lives. Some things to consider when selecting the food you'll give your dog follow.

#### The Dog's Age

Puppies have different nutritional requirements than adult dogs just as human children have different needs than adult people. Senior dogs also have different requirements than younger adult dogs. Make sure that you select a food that is appropriate for your dog's stage in life.

#### The Dog's Health

Does your dog have a specific medical condition? If so, the food you choose may need to be partially dictated by that condition. Diabetic dogs need low-glucose foods and dogs with specific allergies (yes dogs can be allergic to all sorts of things, just like people) may require certain foods as well. Your veterinarian can help you choose foods that are appropriate for a dog with a specific medical condition.

#### The Dog's Size or Body Type

Some dogs are overweight. Some dogs are underweight. Some have a natural tendency to get lots of exercise while others tend to prefer to lie around a lot. There are, of course, small, medium, and large dogs as well as the ultra-tiny 'toy' dogs. All of these different types of dogs will have different requirements for the type of food they need as well as how much of it.

#### Your Budget

Dog food can be expensive, there's no doubt about it. And where dog food is concerned, the rule really is 'you get what you pay for.' Low cost generics and store brands will lighten the burden on your wallet, but may not be the healthiest choice for your dog as they are made with cheap ingredients and lots of fillers. You should buy the best dog food you can on your budget to help ensure your dog's nutrition.

### Cost of feeds

The cost of dog feed is one factor that is most important in the case of feeding of dogs with different kinds of food items. Yes. This is true. The cost factor needs to be looked into in various perspectives during the preparation of the food items, required for the balanced feeding of dogs with proper vitamin and mineral supplementations in the food.

Cost will not always matter much because the dog's value is being assessed in terms of **companionship** and the **happiness** derived from the dog to the dog owner. Though the cost of the food items is comparatively more, many dog owners don't mind much due to the increased benefits derived from their dogs in terms of protection, guiding, etc. 

Selection of ingredients for the home made food needs to be however based on the **quality factor**. Even when the quality is more, general persons may seek some cheaper items only. Recommended nutrient contents may be obtained from the national nutrient academies in all nations and this will provide guidelines.

One can correlate the cost factor with items available in their own country. Generally, the commercial food items are expensive especially the ones that use the **modern technologies** of food preparation like oven-baking, sterilization of cans, air drying or freeze drying of contents etc. 

**Canned items cost more than the dry food items**. However, the cost of the items depends on what kind of food item to be used for the dogs. **Food allergies need to be monitored** during usage of different food items in case of dogs due to the cheaper cost of the items. Often the quality need not be compromised because of the cost factor. 

Most of the dog food items nowadays have mentioned their cost in the label itself. Hence, the dog owner need not have any problem in taking a decision on the purchase.

### Could A Homemade Diet Be Best for Your Dog?

When choosing a dog food there are hundreds of choices. For lots of pets, none of these choices are the right one.A good formula for a homemade diet is one half cereal, rice, or kibbles, and one half meat, including its natural fat, with green or yellow vegetables added from time to time. Since they can be made to measure for each individual dog, these combinations would be ideal if they weren't too much bother. Aside from taking more time and trouble than the other methods, a homemade diet requires a sound knowledge of canine nutrition.

Table scraps are definitely **insufficient** for modern pets who we want to thrive, not merely survive. They are often the direct cause of **obesity** and various allied skin disorders too. Dogs with unusually big appetites or with a tendency to obesity will keep their figures if you cut down on the starch and increase the vegetables, to the proportion of one meat, one fourth kibbles, and one fourth vegetables. Older dogs may need reduced protein to spare their kidneys the task of nitrogen elimination. 

Build your dogs meals around the foods that are **highly recommended** for dogs:

- Beef: (ground or chopped for puppies in chunks for adult dogs, raw or cooked. Dogs prefer their meat a little tough, and they need the fat found in cheaper cuts).

- Lamb and mutton

- Chicken

- Horse Meat

- Beef Hearts and Kidneys

- Beef Liver (no more than once a week, as too much or too often causes loose stools.

- Eggs, hard-boiled or scrambled (The yolk may be given raw, but not the white, which in its raw state destroys biotin, a useful vitamin in the dogs intestine).

- Rice, whole wheat, barley, oats, buckwheat

- While wheat biscuits or toast

- Carrots (cooked or raw, grated and mixed with his meal, or whole for chewing)

- String Beans, spinach (chopped or mashed)

- Cottage Cheese (excellent for weaning puppies)

- Unfermented natural cheese, such as Swiss and Edam Apples and Pears

On the other hand, certain foods should be **considered taboo**:

- White commercial bread

- Cabbage (which causes flatulence and is difficult to digest)

- Potatoes (hard to digest and not very nourishing)

- Starchy Vegetables, such as dried beans

- Spicy dishes and sauces

- Uncooked egg white

- Processed cheese

- Pork (unless it is lean, well cooked, and served infrequently)

- Raw fish

- Delicatessen meats

- Unboned chicken, rabbit and fish

- Cake and candy

- Alcoholic beverages

- Chocolate of any kind

### Conclusion

Which ever method you choose for feeding your dog, it is best to **stick to it**. Once he has become accustomed to a certain diet, he will be **upset** by any sudden change. The upset is apt to take the form of constipation if you change from prepared products to fresh ones, and diarrhea in the opposite case. If a change is needed, make it **gradual** by mixing the old with the new until his body adapts to the change.
