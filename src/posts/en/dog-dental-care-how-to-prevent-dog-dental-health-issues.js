const text = `Do you consider yourself a good dog owner? Is your dog not only the happiest pup on the block, but also the healthiest? 

There are nearly 44 million U.S. households that own approximately 74 million dogs. Although many of these owners treat their dog more like a family member and less like an animal, most are unaware of **one of the biggest health risks for their dog**. 

Home dental care is to be given more emphasis nowadays because of the fact that the dental diseases are emerging in the case of pet animals like dogs to a greater extent. Though you are giving home dental care, if you suspect on the extension of the dental diseases, then **immediately approach the veterinarian** for intervention.

Some people don't realize that dental hygiene is as important for dogs as it is for human beings. Just like in people, dogs' teeth can gather **plaque** after eating. When plaque builds up and hardens it becomes a coarse brown substance called tartar. As tartar accumulates it can work its way under the gums and cause painful infections and gum disease. This goes on in the mouths of dogs just like it does in people. You brush your teeth every day, probably three times. What does your dog do?

### Dogs' Most Frequent Health Problems are Dental Diseases

Periodontal disease is the **most frequently diagnosed** health problem in pets. In fact, more than **80 percent** of dogs have it by the time they are 4 years old.

Periodontal disease begins when bacteria and food debris build up along the dog's gum line. Plaque is created and, soon after, tartar forms on the teeth. Eventually the gums swell, and pockets form that can trap bacteria and lead to more serious problems. 

"Doggy breath, loose teeth, bleeding gums, mouth pain and even infections in the heart, liver and kidney are signs of advanced periodontal disease," says Jan Bellows, DVM and owner of *Hometown Animal Hospital and Dental Clinic* in Weston, Florida. "To avoid these health problems, owners must take steps to care for their dog's teeth-much like they care for their own."

Only one in five owners have ever attempted to brush their pet's teeth and only **2 percent brush with enough frequency** to maintain proper oral health. 

In addition to brushing, Dr. Bellows uses ORAVET, a plaque-prevention gel that stops disease-causing bacteria from attaching to the teeth. It is the only sealant available on the market.

After an in-clinic cleaning, the sealant is applied to the dog's teeth, creating an invisible barrier that reduces bacterial plaque adhesion. Owners then apply the odorless, tasteless homecare gel to the dog's teeth once a week. It typically takes less than a minute to apply. 

"As a veterinarian and as a pet owner, this gel gives me a valuable tool in preventing oral disease in dogs," says Dr. Bellows. "It's easy to use and is a perfect complement to tooth brushing, dental diets and dental chews."

### Teeth Brushing for Doggies

Teeth brushes are available for use with care in case of dogs and one has to be careful during the usage of these brushes in dogs. Teeth brushes are to be used with **special kinds of pastes** recommended by the veterinarians for home use in case of dogs.

Veterinarians recommend that dog owners brush their dog's teeth **at least twice a week** to keep the buildup of tartar at a minimum. Most pet supply stores carry specially designed toothbrushes and toothpaste just for dogs. Remember that a dog's sense of taste and smell is far more acute than that of a human and the zesty, tingly, mint taste of toothpastes for people will be extremely awful to a dog. Try brushing Rover's teeth with Crest just once and it will likely be the last time he lets you anywhere near him with a toothbrush. **Use the specially designed doggie toothpaste.**

The plaque materials are intermittently to be removed at home to avoid any occurrence of the periodontal diseases, which are more common among the dogs.  Dental wipes are available in the pet shops and they may be used carefully in the home.  This helps to remove more plaque and the tartar like materials that are loosely attached. 

### Dental Chew

Some people don't have the time or patience to brush their dogs' teeth on a regular basis. If you're one of these, you'll want to care for Chopper's choppers in another way. A dog's natural tendency to chew is a **built-in dental care** mechanism. Dog biscuits break into small chunks when chewed and rub against the teeth, providing a cleaning service. There's no substitute for brushing your dog's teeth, but if you can't do that, **make sure he gets some sort of crunchy dog biscuit on a regular basis.**

Try to provide bone materials without very sharp points to the dogs and they may love to chew them and then swallow the bitten products. Such activities help them to go for the development of strong teeth structures in a natural manner. 

Mind that the breeds of dogs like Pekingese, etc. are more prone for the development of teeth diseases because the teeth are closely crowned in the oral cavity be to the small size of the these dogs. Hence, these dogs need to be checked up for the excessive plaque formation in the home itself. 

Recreational raw beef bones are wonderful materials to keep the teeth structures of your dog clean and free from formation of plaque with build up of bacterial organisms. 

Specially prepared food materials are available in the pet shops to remove the tartar and the plaque materials from the teeth structures. **Dry dog food and toys** that are specially made to add strength to the teeth structures are often used at home for better teeth cleaning.

### Mouth Diseases in Dogs

Preventing dental disease is an important feature, which is to be paid more emphasis by the dog lovers or dog owners. Dental disease is given priority in the health schedule of the dog nowadays because of the association of the dental diseases with systemic diseases in the dogs.

Dogs that do not receive proper dental care and do not have access to crunchy teeth cleaning foods run the risk of several types of mouth disease. These can be as mild as gingivitis (a gum disease that results in swollen, inflamed gums) and as serious as a bacterial infection that can spread through the dog's bloodstream **causing damage to vital organs**. You owe it to yourself and your dog to take care of his teeth.

Antibiotics need to be given in the initial stage of teeth infection itself and if not, this may cause specific infections and the organisms may spread to the other nearby regions like the oral mucous membrane and pharyngeal region etc. 

More acidic or alkaline food materials need not be given to the dogs to avoid the possible teeth damage.  Antibiotics need to be given in the initial stage of teeth infection itself and if not, this may cause specific infections and the organisms may spread to the other nearby regions like the oral mucous membrane and pharyngeal region etc.  More acidic or alkaline food materials need not be given to the dogs to avoid the possible teeth damage.  **If the dog is not given at its young age some bony material to bite on, the dog may develop some dental diseases later.** The teething action often causes the animal to go for biting in an indiscriminate manner. Hence, the animal has to be given some biting materials to avoid the occurrence of dental diseases. 

If there is an evidence of bleeding from the oral region, the dog needs to be examined thoroughly for any dental abnormality.  Mainly the puppies or some times, the adult dogs also may have teeth injuries. They need to be **attended immediately** as a preventive step. If not, the animal may end up in secondary bacterial infections.

Hunting dogs need **additional care** associated with the dental structures and such care is needed to avoid the future dental problems in such dogs.  Brushes are available to provide better dental care to dogs. However, one has to allot more time and should have patience to use such brushes in case of dogs. This may lead into further problems. Centers for disease control and prevention are trying to put up guidelines to prevent the dental diseases in dogs in many nations. However, the oral examination needs to be carried out frequently in dogs and such activities help to rule out the emerging problems pertaining to the dentine structures in the beginning itself.

### Doggie Dentistry

Dental services are available for dogs, just like they are for people. A dog's teeth can be filled, capped, and extracted if necessary, just like a human's. The best course of action, however, is to avoid the need for such services by properly caring for your dog's teeth. If you can avoid unnecessary pain and discomfort for your furry friend, you should do so. Preventative doggie dental care can save you money as well. Doggie dental procedures can be **quite costly**.

### Conclusion

As explained throughout this article, dental diseases are the one of most frequently diagnosed health problems for dogs. If you're not caring about your dog's dental health, you should at least be regularly giving your dog something to chew to prevent dental diseases. That's what veterinarians strongly recommend and you should consider it especially if you don't want to brush your dog's teeth everyday (which I totally understand). It is worth it to spend time on your dog's health as it's a great way to have your dog around for many years.

Here's what you should keep in mind :
- Dental diseases are the **most frequent health issues** so it's a good idea to care about your dog's teeth
- Brushing your dog's teeth is recommended by veterinarians but if you don't have time to do it or you don't want to, at least **give him food or toys to chew**
- Your dog can't talk so to see if he has health issues, you have to **observe him** to see if he has any symptoms. If so, see if you can do something. If you can't do anything or if your dog is really feeling bad, take him to the veterinarian as soon as you can.
