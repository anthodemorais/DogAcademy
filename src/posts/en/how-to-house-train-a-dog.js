One of the most confusing and anxiety-ridden areas of dog training is house training. Yet, it is one of the **most important**, especially for the humans involved.

Every dog needs to be trained in the house, and the process is quite *long*. Just like during our childhood we never used proper toilet, even the dogs may do toilet on carpets. So, they must **never be scolded.**

Dog house training requires you to be extremely attentive and do a **lot of work**, thus making it one of the toughest techniques of dog training. You may believe that the dog will bark when he needs the toilet, but if you are not lucky enough to have such a dog, then be prepared to have an accident with the results showing all over the house! So, it is always better that you learn to read your dog's body language.

The best way to understand and find success with house training is to **use the dog's own nature** to help you.

If you do so, dog training is quite simple and requires you to follow quite a few steps. However, it is, as already said, time consuming. To start with, it is best to put a **newspaper at the door**, so that when you find your dog doing one of those accidents in the house, you can immediately take him there. That way your dog learns to do it on the paper the next time he needs to do, without your help.  

Dogs are, by instinct, very **clean animals**. They would rather not soil any areas where they normally sleep or eat. Dogs are also creatures of habit --- they like to know where they're supposed to go urinate and defecate. If the dog is taught to eliminate on gravel or concrete, they will tend to look for either of those surfaces to do so. If they're taught to eliminate on grass or dirt, that's where they will choose. Use these habits to your advantage.

### Setting up the training area

This is the first step. Make sure the area you choose is small and confined. A bathroom works for this, or a place in a kitchen or garage also work well. Remember that crate training works well for puppies or small dogs, but for the larger animals, the crate is too confining.

You need to spend some time with this aspect of the training. You need to **play with your dog in this area**, and this is also where the dog will be taught to sleep and eat. Put together a special bed. This can be something you make up with items around the house, or you can go to the store and purchase a bed. Don't worry of your dog eliminates in this area at first. Once they figure out that this is where the sleep and eat, they'll stop eliminating there.

Once your dog realizes that the bed is for sleeping, you can begin to move it around the house. But, **only when you're there**. When you're not, put the bed back in the training area.

### Setting up the toilet area

Now you need to determine where the toilet area is going to be located. Presumably, this will be outside the house. Wherever it is, it has to be a place that the dog can go to whenever it needs to go. You need to go there with your dog so you can give the appropriate **rewards** for good behavior.

For your house training, you need to know that when your dog wants to toilet, he would tend to get restless and start sniffing around the place. At this point you must **pick up your dog and take him outside**. If it is a young puppy, then you must make sure to take him out **every hour**, for at least once. After taking your dog out, you need to give him the command you wish to use during the training, such as 'do the toilet' or 'do your business'.  Now, the dog must be appreciated for following your commands and thus you must give him lots of affection after he has done his work (since it is always better to wait till he is finished!). This would help in making your dog realize that the place to do it is outside, and soon you would find him asking you to take him out when he needs to do it.

Establish a set **feeding schedule** for your dog. If the dog is in the habit of being fed at certain times, the natural process of elimination will also begin to occur at certain times. Once you learn when those times relate to the eating times, it will become much easier for you to guide the dog to the established toilet area.

Don't forget to make sure your dog has ready access to the toilet area. That way mistakes aren't as likely to occur. It must be borne in mind that dogs have to be taught to do toilet outside, as no dog knows it by himself. So, you must teach your dog in case you do not want accidents in your house, and do remember to clean up the mess. 

Long story short, remember :
- No pup is able to keep himself from peeing or well relieving himself in some other form, till about **12 weeks of age**. Your attempts at training your dog therefore must begin before this.

- Most puppies need to engage in bathroom related activities approximately *6-7 times a day*

- Every time your dog seems to be following its tail rather slowly, and doing giddy rounds around a non-descriptive area put your shoes on to take it out cause it's getting ready to relieve itself

- Take your dog out every time it has a meal because food immediately puts pressure on its colon and bladder.

### Continuing the house training process

Once your dog is in the habit of eliminating in the toilet area and not in the sleeping/eating area, you can begin to **extend the training area** to the rest of the house. Do this slowly. Start by expanding to one additional room, and then **gradually** expand into other areas. Don't expand into new areas until you're sure your dog has control of its bladder and bowels. At first, do this only when you're around. If you're away, then put your dog back in the original training area.

### Speeding up the process

If you have to move this process along more quickly, you can do so. Remember to proceed with **caution**, though. It's better to go slowly than to have to try to retrain a dog later. If you're going to try to speed things up, you will have to be there in order to reward your dog for successful eliminations. It is also important not to punish for mistakes. That will only confuse the dog and slow the process even further.

There are a number of training techniques and routines that you may use to train your dog at home. Some do work and some don't and you should try them better understand your dog and **know which technique you should apply.**

### Hiring someone to house train your dog

There are special services available which do home dog training. For a fee you can hire someone to come to your home to teach your dog every day. You choose how long you want the program to last then they will end out a specialized handler who will determine what is the most effective training method for your dog then carry it out and of course you have to join in to.

Home dog training is relatively new on the dog marketing scene and is quite a hit especially in America. It's not because people are lazy so they are hiring professionals. It's because they need someone with a lot of experience to help them train their dog. Maybe their dog is giving them a hard time!

One of the largest home dog training services are *Bark Busters*, they are a globally known home dog training service and have achieved results all over the world. There are hundreds of testimonials and reviews available so read one for yourself. They have sites in all parts of the globe. They offer a lifetime guarantee as well; you should visit their website to read more about them and the services they offer, also to see if you live close to a visiting dog trainer.

There is another large home dog training service located in the UK only, they are called *Dog Training UK*. One feature with them is that they don't actually train your dog at your home. They take them away to a place kind of like kennels for three weeks and train them there, so when your dog is returned to you he can do all the things that you have been trying to teach him for months! They can only accept dogs which are up to date with their vaccinations and cannot train very aggressive dogs.

You can also simply do a quick research on Google to see if there is a dog trainer near you that can train your dog at home. I tried that and I got a lot of results. You should find someone easily if you live in a big city.

Many people are turning to home dog training as it is convenient and helpful especially if you haven't had experiences training a dog before. A lot of people get tense and irritated when their dog doesn't do what they say but that doesn't help. Training a dog can be a very stressful time and home dog training just makes it that much easier. **I say if it's there for the taking, why not?!**

However, keep in mind that house training your dog creates a **very strong bond between you** so it is worth trying to do it yourself. These solutions are best used if you don't have the time to do it yourself or if you are not patient.

House training your dog takes time but with the right methods, you just have to be patient so if you try, don't give up because the relationship you will have with your dog afterwards will be *exceptional*!

### Things to keep in mind

The most import lesson you have to keep in mind is to **communicate with your dog**. Make sure you let your dog know that you don't like him peeing all over the drawing room loud and clear. No, there isn't any need to use violence; just a loud *'NO'* should do the trick. For best results catch him in the act so that he has no problem in associating the rebuke with the exact action.
