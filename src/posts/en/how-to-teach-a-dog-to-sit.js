A poorly trained dog is a direct reflection on you the pet owner and how much care about your dog. In fact an untrained dog becomes a nuisance to its owner therefore the dog and owner become unhappy. Whether it's a puppy or a fully grown dog you can teach them to sit with a little effort on your part.

Have you been putting it off because you think your dog will never be able to learn a new 'trick'? **Don't put it off any longer**. Start teaching your dog how to sit today. 

*'Why does your dog sit when you tell him to and mine doesn't?", 'How can your dog heel to you like that?' 'Wow! He comes when you tell him to'*

Sound familiar?  If it does, you need to invest some time into a little bit of basic dog training. Starting to train your dog from a young age is crucial, as the first few months of his life is when you will have the greatest influence on him; this is where he is shaped into the dog he is going to be when he is all grown up.

The most basic of dog training is to get your dog to sit and come. Teaching your dog those commands are essential for him to learn. These commands are used for various different reasons, if you are in competition, if your dog jumps making him sit will immediately get him off, and "come" is the all important one. If you take your dog for a walk, you let him of the leash and you expect him to come back to you, not run around the park with you chasing after him shouting at him to 'get here right this instance'. That would be just down right embarrassing!

To teach your dog how to come requires only the most basic of techniques but a lot of repetition. The simplest way to get him to come is have a toy in one hand and a treat in the other, when you are in the house simply walk away from him, hold out the toy and excitingly call him to you, when he comes over give him a treat, always use the command for come that you are going to use in the future. Doing this several times a day is a great way to teach him, but remember to have lots of long breaks so he doesn't get bored and stop enjoying it, and don't forget the treats!

Getting him to sit could be a slight bit harder but again only requires basic dog training. When you have mastered the come command call him to you, place your hand on the end of his back and say "sit" while gently pushing down on his backside, when he sits his bottom down give him a treat and a lot of praise. If you want him to sit longer just delay giving him the treat and the praise, get him to sit but take your time bending down to him and feeding him his tidbits.

Basic dog training is simple and very effective. It should also be fun for you and your dog, it does not have to be hours and hours each day just may be 5 minutes or so. Do not forget to reward your dog and yourself for all the 'hard' work though!

You are going to need some treats; unfortunately this is **always the best way** to get a dog to do something you want! You can use anything you know your dog enjoys: biscuits, chewy treats or household items.

The main goal is to get your dog to sit when you use the word. One way you can gradually get your dog used to the word is by **saying the word when the dog is sitting anyway**. Dog sits down - you say "sit" and praise them. 


### The Methods to Teach Your Dog To Sit

A badly trained dog is an annoyance and can even be a threat to himself and others. A correctly trained dog, on the other had, is a fantastic and enjoyable buddy. In addition to assisting you to bond, it can even shield your pet from being harmed if he pays attention and will come when called.

When teaching, always keep in mind that dogs react best to encouraging, backing and shouting at your dog and beating him will not get done the job, in its place use rewards such as goodies and your appreciation - this will make the job much more enjoyable for both of you!

There is a general 'process' to teaching, no matter what you want the dog to do. They solution is to get the dog to carry out the act and at that precise instant give the instruction for the act, then command the dog and reward him with a goody. After a while, he will get the message and connect the act with the instruction.

Given below, the 15 ways you can make use of to teach your dog with the most fundamental instruction 'Sit':

1. *The first thing you have to do is to get your puppy or dog to connect the action of sitting with the instruction*. To do this, merely spend time with your dog and when he sits give the 'sit' instruction.

2. *Going down to your dog's height* will let you to give his reward (goodies) faster so take hold of a handful of bite sized goodies and got down on the floor.

3. *Take the goody up above the dog's head*. He will smell the food and go behind it with his nose. This act will compel him to sit - or backup, but apparently we are hopeful for the sitting act.

4. The solution to the teaching is to *give the reward at the precise instant the dog sits*, but you have got to also give the instruction at that instant as well so that he links instruction with act.

5. *Shower praise on your dog*, demonstrate delight in your voice; this will actually make him act in response.

6. *Go over three to five times* at each sitting but no more than that. Training should be enjoyable and not an uninteresting odd job, so do not go over the top with it in one sitting. You might have more than a few sittings all through the day.

7. *Call your dog and offer them the treat*. Let them sniff the treat and get excited first! 

8. *Slowly move the treat until it's over the dogs head*. The dog will naturally move into the sitting position. 

10. *Keep bribing the dog and gradually decrease the size of the treat*. Keep enthusiastically praising the dog. 

11. *Repeat this exercise a few times a day*. Don't overdo it - you want your pet to think of it as fun. 

12. *Try to practice around mealtimes when your dog is hungry*; this will make him keener for the treats. 

13. *Have the treats easily accessible, don't fumble around* - the treat needs to happen as the dog is sitting. 

14. *Don't push your dog's bottom down*; this won't work because your pet will associate the action of sitting with having you push his bottom to the ground. If this really isn't working you might want to consider obedience classes with other dogs. 

15. *End each training session on a positive note.*
