const text = `There are many different styles and types of dog cages on the market and as expected there is also a **huge range of prices**.

While you might find people opposed to the suggestion of using dog cages, it is in actual fact something that most dogs are **comfortable** with.

Dog cages can offer your dog a sense of **security**, much like a child has a security blanket. By having their own little area they have a sense of security and this security can go with them if there is a need to travel.

If they feel safe within their dog cage they are less likely to become stressed when traveling in a motor vehicle.

By adding a favorite blanket or padding to the dog cage, the animal will feel **comfortable and happy** in familiar surroundings.

When buying a dog cage it needs to be **big enough** to allow your dog to **stand up and turn around**, but doesn't need to be any larger than that for the dog to feel comfortable. There will need to be enough room for the dog to lie down on it's side with it's legs outstretched and sleep comfortably.

Usually the biggest problem will be whether your motor vehicle is big enough to fit the dog cage inside, in a safe place.

You can expect to pay between **$50 and $125** for a good quality dog cage that will be big enough for a medium to large dog.

It is a small price to pay for all the benefits of **dog happiness and security**, along with **ease of transportation**. A good quality dog cage **should last the life of the animal** if handled correctly, which makes it a relatively cheap investment.

The cage should be purchased based on the size of the **full grown animal** as you won't want to be replacing it after a year or so when you find that it is too small to house your pet when it is fully grown.

Some dog cages have dividers that are useful when transporting puppies as they restrict the area of the cage that they have access to, and as they grow the divider can be removed so they can use the whole cage.

When deciding on a dog cage you should look at **all the alternatives** that are offered by the biggest pet retailers on the Internet and look at all the price comparison websites to get the best deals.

### What you should consider when choosing a dog house

Dog owners have to consider **several factors** when buying or building a house for their pets. As a true member of your own family, providing your pet with the best home possible is of the utmost importance. 

#### 1. The house's size

A German Shepherd, Golden Retriever, Rottweiler and other large dogs should have **large houses** obviously, while the Chihuahua and smaller breeds will need **smaller houses**. The door of the house does not need to be based on the height of the dog from the ground to the top of its head, or even taller, as it will lower its head to be able to enter the house. The width of the door should be just enough to accommodate the dog. These height and width measurements can be adjusted if there is a physical requirement to do so. The house should also be **large enough** for the dog to **stand** at full height inside, move around and lie down. Owners should remember that a larger-than-needed home will **compromise the dog's retention of body heat **during the winter or colder months. 

#### 2. The Weather Conditions

Some dog houses are made with hinged roofs, a feature that allows owners to raise the roof during hot and humid weather. This flexibility provides **adequate air flow** to flush out warm air and allow fresh or cool air to enter. In some cases, these roofs can also be lowered, creating a smaller space for the dog and enhancing its ability to **retain heat**  during rainy or cold weather. Asphalt shingles should be used only if there is an adequate insulation barrier separating the roof from the main area of the house. Many house models also come with slanted roofs, ensuring that water **drains away** during rainy days. Owners should **avoid** building or buying houses with **barn-type or peak-style roofs**, as these would attract hornets, wasps and other insects and prevent heat retention. Another option is wind walls, which can be inserted into the dog house to break the wind and keep the house warmer. The house should also be a reasonable distance off the ground to keep it dry. For owners with bigger budgets, some house manufacturers offer provisions for heaters and air-conditioners. These climate control systems help ensure comfort for the dog regardless of weather conditions.

#### 3. The size and number of doors

The front door of the dog house should be located to **one side instead of in the middle**. This will prevent the dog from being **directly exposed** to extreme weather conditions and other harsh environmental elements. Some models are designed with removable doors, or with no doors at all. Using a door will help keep the dog house **warmer** during cold months. An awning type cover can also be used over the opening for added shade and protection.

#### 4. It should be easy to clean and maintain

- Removable or adjustable roofs

- Doors, partitions

- Wind walls

- Flexibility in cleaning

- Restrict use of paint, stains, or water sealers for the outside of the house

#### 5. Use Wood

Plastic and metal houses are not a good idea, as they are either **too hot** during summertime or **too cold** during the winter. Some market experts say that houses made from **natural western red cedar wood** offer the best insulation for dogs during winter while making them cooler during summer. Red cedar wood oils are also natural repellants of ticks, fleas and termites. Houses made from this material are also **maintenance-free** on the outside, although owners have a choice of finishing it to complement their property. Sprinkling red cedar wood chips or shavings in the bedding also helps prevent infestation. Owners should also remember that wooden roofs help cut down heat build-up from the sun while helping to maintain reasonable heat retention levels.

#### 6. Keep The Dog House Elevated

For legless houses, the owner must remember that having it directly on the ground increases the likelihood that the pet would be exposed to cold and wet weather. This also raises the possibility of infestation from flea eggs that hatch in the soil. The owner can use bricks, rocks or stones arranged in a level and stable manner to elevate the house. The elevation will allow air to flow beneath the house and prevent moisture from forming at the bottom.

#### 7. Consider your dog's breed and age

You should also consider learning some key points about your dog's breed. It is not necessary for you to know everything there is to know about the breed but you should have a general understanding of factors including the energy level of the breed (depending on his age), the natural temperament of the breed, the health conditions common in the breed (again depending on the age) and other information important for ownership of a particular breed.

It is important to match the temperament of the puppy to appropriate homes. In general, puppies that develop personalities that are more **outgoing and adventurous** will do well in homes with children who may be rambunctious. In contrast puppies with more timid personalities are better suited for **quiet homes** with only adults and older children. Likewise puppies with more dominant personalities should only be placed in homes with dogs that are submissive or in homes where the puppy will be an only dog. However, dogs that are more submissive may do well in homes with an existing older dog

### Conclusion

You should keep in mind the steps we mentioned to buy or build your dog's house because your dog is likely to spend a lot of time inside his house. This is one of the most impactful things you can do for your dog to be happy.
