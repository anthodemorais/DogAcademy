const text = `### Is you dog aggressive ?

If your dog is aggressive and never listens to you, you have a very **serious problem**. There are new laws that state dog's owner can be charged and the dog put down if the dog bites someone. Of course with some serious dog training, your dog can learn to **enjoy people** not turn on them.

There are lots of reasons why dogs are or become aggressive. Maybe the dog feels his **territory is being compromised**, or he feels **threatened**. A lot of aggression comes from **lack of confidence and insecurity**. Simple obedience will not solve your dog's aggressive problems only some serious dog training will do the trick. Aggressiveness doesn't just mean biting; it means barking and lunging at people as well. This type of behavior needs to be addressed as soon as possible to prevent anything serious from happening to someone or another dog.

**Your vet can recommend you** how to go about finding someone who can work with aggressive dogs. Training aggressive dogs is a specialty and unfortunately could **cost you a fair amount of money**, but the end result is well **worth it** and you don't have to worry about losing your dog. Most obedience and training schools wont take aggressive dogs as most of the places run classes with other members and won't let them be endangered. The best thing you can do is to take him to a proper dog school. Look in your yellow pages for one or do quick researches on Google.

Always check the techniques used by schools on how they train aggressive dogs as training an aggressive dog can be **dangerous** some places may use out of date methods which could be **harmful** to your dog, although this isn't always the case it is always better to be safe than sorry. I wish I could say it was easy to train your do not to be aggressive but **it isn't**.

At the end of the day what counts is that your dog **stops attacking** and he starts loving. An aggressive dog can halter the relationship that you have with him therefore you and your dog aren't having the best time together as you are always worried about him biting you, other people or other dogs. I recommend that you do what it takes to get the problem sorted!

### Stopping Bad Behavior

As explained before, bad behavior in dogs can consist of many problems. Does he bark all night long and keeps you from sleeping? Are you afraid he is going to keep biting? Does he chew everything except his toys? If the answer to any of these questions are yes you need to invest some time into a little bit of dog behavior training. **A little training will go a long way**.

Dogs that bark can be extremely **irritating** but the main thing is **not to loose your cool**, if you shout at him he will try to shout louder than you. Try and find out the cause of his barking. Is he barking because he is **afraid**? Is he **happy**? Is there someone out there? If you can't find the reason for the barking then he is doing it because **he doesn't know it is wrong to bark** all the time. This is where dog behavior training comes in. There are lots of products available to help dogs with constant barking, there are special collars which gives them the tiniest of electric shocks so they know that it isn't good to bark.

A biting dog is maybe one of the more serious behavior problems, especially now that the laws are tightened and any dog that bites someone is more than likely to get **put down**. Teaching your dog not to bite is one of the **most important** teachings you can give him. This is where you have to be **firm** and stick to your guns. When playing with a young dog they will automatically nip and gnaw at your hand this is because when dogs play together they play with their mouths. When teaching your dog not to bite stroke him with one hand while offering something which is acceptable to be bitten with the other hand, something like a chew toy or a raw hide treat. **Your dog will soon realize that hands aren't there for biting**. This process has to be done **repeatedly** for it to take effect.

Dog behavior training is simple enough for the experienced dog lover but when it comes to beginners all the help available is needed. **Accept help** from friends and family and maybe even enroll in a dog behavior training class, this will help you to meet other people, having the same problems with their dogs that you are with yours. You are not alone when it comes to having trouble with dog behavior problems. Every dog will get them, it's just a matter of how you fix them.

### Strategies to train a dog

If you want your dog to listen and stop being aggressive, you need to learn some dog training techniques. They are harmless and aid free ways to train your dog to listen to what you have to say to him.

There is one dog training technique which I have tried and tested and it is great. It's called the *'Nothing in life is free'* technique. It basically works on the fact that **nothing is free**, your dog has to do something to get something in return. For example if he wants food he has to remain seated until you make his dinner, or if you want to talk him for a walk then he has to lie down until you put his leash and collar on. These training techniques all are based on the fact that **your dog will realize to get what he wants he has to do what you are telling him to do**. What if he doesn't do it? Walk away. **Don't shout at him** or keep trying if he doesn't listen just ignore him and walk away then about 5 minutes later go back and **try again**. He soon comes to realize that you are in charge and he has to do what you say to get what wants.

When dogs are born they usually have siblings and their mother is the *'Leader of the pack'*, when a young dog leaves his mother he starts to think that he is free and can do **what he wants**. When he first joins a family he starts to act **dominant**. He tries to be leader of the house. You can't let him gain this position you need to **show him through dog training techniques that humans are the head of your house** not the dog. He does not have to be aggressive to get what he wants. Sometimes dogs use the sympathetic approach using their puppy dog eyes. This is just another attempt at trying to get higher in the dominance hierarchy and you can't let them get ahead of you.

When it comes to kids dog's see them more as playmates than masters as children can get down to their height and play with them, under adult supervision when your child gets to around the age of nine you can start to **teach them to use dog training techniques** so they can show the dog that when they ask him to do something he has to listen to them, not just listen to you.

Dog training techniques are extremely efficient and very simple to carry out, the training doesn't even seem like training it just **requires repetition** and you dog will soon catch on that nothing in life is free!

### Understanding when to reward and when to punish your dog

There are certain things which should be kept in mind while training one's dog. There are different techniques of dog training. 

Some of these techniques are quite useful, while some others can bear negative results. It is therefore quite natural to get confused with so many sides of dog training, as it is difficult to tell which one works the best. 

The most common confusion, which people tend to have, is **when to reward and when to rebuke the dog**. If you are such a confused one, the following tips will help you. 

Your dog-training instructor will probably tell you that you should always keep a positive air while dog training. But actually you would need to be **stern** in certain situations. 

However, you must not scold your dog too frequently, as dogs always give a better response if they get a **positive behavior from their trainer**. So it is first important for you to realize when to praise your dog. 

Your dog should get a **reward every time he obeys** you during the training process. You should reward him if he sits, stays, fetches, goes to toilet in the proper place, or does anything he his ordered.

His rewards can be anything: praises or kind words, treats, a rub on his belly, or a pat on his head!

Positive dog training makes the learning process **quicker**. What your dog actually wants is to please you, and that is why it will respond better with this kind of teaching. But make sure that you do not go on rewarding him even when he disobeys you.

Scolding is something, which should not be used unless it is **necessary**. You can reprimand your dog if he jumps, barks, growls, pulls at his leash, destroys anything, or excretes where he should not.  

However, do not scold him **unless you catch him doing something wrong**.

Or else, he will not realize why you are reproving him. A quick and sharp *'no!'* or *'bad dog!'* should be enough of a scolding.

You should keep an **angry condemning tone**, and make sure that you are crisp and quick in your scolding. But if you are too frequent in your reproaches, your dog will ultimately start **ignoring you**. **Do not ever hit the dog**, as it will only lead to complications in future. 

These are the points that you should keep in mind when you decide to praise or scold your dog. Do not forget that your pet has only started learning, and is trying to do his best. So **patience** is something that you must have. 

If you are loving and understanding enough, your dog would find the training easy, and ultimately it will be a wonderful experience for you two!
